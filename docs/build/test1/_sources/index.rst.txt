Genome Instability Pipeline
===========================

The Genome Instability Pipeline (GIP) will solve your problem of analyzing whole genome sequencing (WGS) data 
making bioinformatics screenings faster and easier
GIP allows the batch processing of multiple WGS experiments, including the mapping of short reads, the quantification of chromosomes, genes and genomic bins.
The results of GIP are summarized in a *report* page providing sequencing experiment and mapping statistics, graphical representations of genomic features quantifications, and excel tables.

GIP also enables **giptools**, a tool-suite allowing to  **detect**, **compare** and **visualize** 

* aneuploidy changes
* gene copy number variants (CNVs)
* single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
* structural variants (SVs)

Look how easy it is to use.
Run GIP on a large set of input WGS experiments (e.g. 200 samples)

  ``nextflow gip.nf --genome sequenceFile --annotation annotationFile --index input.tsv -c config``

  
Compare gene CNVs in 3 specific isolates

  ``./giptools ternary --gipOut gipOutDir --samples Lmj_A445 Lmj_1948 Ltr_16``
