Introduction to GIP
###################
GIP is a tool for scientific investigation, compatible with Linux and OS X systems and distributed as a self-contained package.

GIP consists in 3 files:

* gip.nf: The Nextflow pipeline
* gip.config: The configuration file
* giptools: The Singularity image  

All the (many) required software dependencies already are already embedded in the Singularity container.

Thanks to the Nextflow implementation GIP can be executed on a local machine (default), on cluster resource manager or the cloud.
