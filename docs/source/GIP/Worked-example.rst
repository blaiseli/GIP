* Worked example: i.e. a tutorial on how to run a dummy test with 3 leishmania data sets
  - say where you can find the genome (e.g. ENSEMBL, tritrip), and where you can download data, otherwise assume you generated data locally 
  - prepare the index file
  - prepare the configuration file
  - run 
  - modify parameter and re-run
