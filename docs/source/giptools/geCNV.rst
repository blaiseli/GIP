Purpose
-------
The ``geCNV`` module aims at comparing the gene sequencing coverage of 2 samples to identify gene CNVs.


Algorithm
---------

The module loads for the two samples the GIP files with the gene sequencing coverage values (.covPerGe.gz files) and calculates for each gene the ratio of the normalized coverage values.
