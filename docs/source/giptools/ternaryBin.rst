Purpose
-------
The ``ternaryBin`` module aims at comparing the bin sequencing coverage of 3 samples to identify CNVs regions.


Algorithm
---------

The module loads for the three samples the GIP files with the bin sequencing coverage values (.covPerBin.gz files) and generates a ternary diagram of the normalized coverage values. In this representation, the values coverage values in the 3 samples sum to a constant represented for convenience as 100%.
