-changed covPerBin and covPerGe functions. Now are much faster.
-The covPerBin format. The "mean" and "median" columns have been replaced by "meanCoverage" and "normalizedMeanCoverage" to be consistent with the covPerGe format (and because computing the bin median is CPU intensive for big genomes)
-Changed all the gip parts in which covPerGe or covPerBin are called with the new command execution.
-Changed the downstream scripts using the covPerBin function or accepting covPerBin files (adapting the syntax to read them).
-removed BITFLAG option
-introduced delDup option
-chromosomes now accept the "all" option to consider all the chromosomes by default

#v1.0.2- 23092020#

-introduced Red as a default tool to mask repeat
-removed unused:
genePredToBed 
gtfToGenePred 
exonGTF_2_fasta.sh 
prepareAssembly.sh 
gtf2bed12.sh 
-the user must have the caution to specify all the input parameters not relative to the host system, but relative to where the data will be visible in the container. 
So all he/she needs to do is:
1) bind the directory ('-B  /ebi/fq/:/fq')
2) provide the input files relative to the mounted directory (--reads /fq/sample.fastq.gz )

-Adopted miniCRAN local R packages repository 
-Renamed giptools.sif
-prepared several contrast modules:
  SNV
  binCNV
  binDensity
  geCNV
  geInteraction
  genomeDistance
  karyotype
  ternary
  ternaryBin

Error when run on TARS Due to the fact that the R libraries were searched in the host home and not on the container

 Error: package or namespace load failed for 'VariantAnnotation' in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):
 namespace 'DBI' 1.0.0 is being loaded, but >= 1.1.0 is required

===> Workaround in the cluster
export R_LIBS=/usr/local/lib/R/library/
export R_LIBS_USER=/usr/local/lib/R/library/
then in the NF config envWhitelist='R_LIBS,R_LIBS_USER'

===> R_LIBS and R_LIBS_USER are now also exported in the definition file. I need to test if the new container works in the cluster without the need to export those variables there and defining envWhitelist

#NOTE CHANGES#
##############
1) The coverage readout of nt bin and gene is now without MAPQ filters. The covPerNt, covPerBin and covPerGe files don't consider now any read MAPQ filter. Then it is the downstream analysis that decides what nt bin or gene to filter/mask. This is a nice improvement!
2) in snpEff the user can introduce the notion of ncRNAs by providing a GTF file which specifies the ncRNA biotype. Rwad snpEff documentation
