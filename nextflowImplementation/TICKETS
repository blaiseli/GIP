7) You should remove all the L-GERT job arrays scripts that are not used anyway.


6) develop the sampleComparison master script in bash or R, processing the user input in singularity run or exec. Comparison modes:
-karyotype boxplots
-geCNV pairwise
-geCNV triangle
-overlay SNV frequency
-SNVs venn diagrams up to 6 samples
-covPerBin pairwise
-covPerBin smooth/manhattan
-bin/gene to CNVs (including CNV correlation map and network analysis)
-mummer ANI PCA distance

The Rscripts names should match the MODE tag.

5) fix the portability problem to the cluster. You get the error:
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'VariantAnnotation' in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]):
 namespace 'DBI' 1.0.0 is being loaded, but >= 1.1.0 is required
the prepareGenome step has a problem because the leishmaniaRepeat library is searched in the wrong place 

5===> Workaround in the cluster
export R_LIBS=/usr/local/lib/R/library/
export R_LIBS_USER=/usr/local/lib/R/library/
then in the NF config envWhitelist='R_LIBS,R_LIBS_USER'

4) generate a report karioplote with all the analysis together

3) process the repeatMasker output with something like /pasteur/entites/HubBioIT/gio/apps/my_scripts/various/reduceRepeatMaskerMotifsComplexity.pl

2) you can improve the freebayes step by running it in multi-process fashion

1) change the logo and the pipeline name to gip (genome instability pipeline)





NOTE CHANGES
1) The coverage readout of nt bin and gene is now without MAPQ filters. The covPerNt, covPerBin and covPerGe files don't consider now any read MAPQ filter. Then it is the downstream analysis that decides what nt bin or gene to filter/mask. This is a nice improvement!
2) in snpEff the user can introduce the notion of ncRNAs by providing a GTF file which specifies the ncRNA biotype. Rwad snpEff documentation
