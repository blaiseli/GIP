1) add a final process in which you build the reports. To do that use the "join" operator making sure that you join the output channels from the same sample id
2) check if it is the case to update the snpEff database including the notion of ncRNA exons
3) generate a report karioplote with all the analysis together
4) process the repeatMasker output with something like /pasteur/entites/HubBioIT/gio/apps/my_scripts/various/reduceRepeatMaskerMotifsComplexity.pl

NOTE CHANGES
1) The coverage readout of nt bin and gene is now without MAPQ filters. The covPerNt, covPerBin and covPerGe files don't consider now any read MAPQ filter. Then it is the downstream analysis that decides what nt bin or gene to filter/mask. This is a nice improvement!
