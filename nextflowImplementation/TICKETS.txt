 
5) develop the sampleComparison master script in bash or R, processing the user input in singularity run or exec. Comparison modes:
-raxML SNV tree (consider to implement this as a nexflow pipeline to run the bootsraps and the starting trees in parallel on the cluster)  and 
-bin/gene to CNVs (including CNV correlation map and network analysis)
-mash k-mer PCA distance (possibly add a gip process to generate the sketch files)
-mash k-mer screen to look for contaminants starting from short reads and the mash refsseq database

4) generate a report karioplote with all the analysis together

3) process the repeatMasker output with something like /pasteur/entites/HubBioIT/gio/apps/my_scripts/various/reduceRepeatMaskerMotifsComplexity.pl

2) you can improve the freebayes step by running it in multi-process fashion

1) report to fix:
-Figure 5: Genomic bin coverage overview --> should start always at zero. See if you need to tune the max ylim, anyway the redline should be marked on the axis. Works on the dummy VM test, but not on TARS
-make sure that the links to files work well both on the VM andd on TARS
