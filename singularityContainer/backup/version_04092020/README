first version working also on the TARS cluster
everything works fine.
The only thing is that this version uses rpkginstall, which download each time the R packages to install.
This may represent a problem since some of the packages may be unavailable in the future.
To solve this problem now GIP relies in a local R packages repository (see Rpkgs folder).
All the all the packages source files are stored and their dependencies indexed in the miniCRAN folder (I ran buildMiniCran.R to build it).
When we build the singularity image now we install from the miniCRAN local repository, using the installRpkgs.R script
